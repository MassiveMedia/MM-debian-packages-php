This is to easily create another php package.

To use:
- copy the debian directory into the source directory
- Create a debian/copyright file with license information (this file is
  free-form)
- Edit debian/rules, add any needed configure arguments to the
  override_dh_auto_configure target
- Edit debian/control, follow the instructions there.
- Replace any instance of PACKAGE in debian/control and debian/PACKAGE.install
  by your package name
- rename debian/PACKAGE.install to the right location, similar to above
- run 'dch --create', and edit the initial changelog entry
- run dpkg-buildpackage, as usual.
