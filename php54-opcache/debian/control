Description: The Zend OPcache for PHP
 The Zend OPcache provides faster PHP execution through opcode caching and
 optimization. It improves PHP performance by storing precompiled script
 bytecode in the shared memory. This eliminates the stages of reading code
 from the disk and compiling it on future access. In addition, it applies a few
 bytecode optimization patterns that make code execution faster.
